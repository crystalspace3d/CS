Crystal Space detailed change log.

The overall history is in reverse (descending) chronological order, so that
each new day's entries apears before the previous day's entries.  The
individual changes for each given day, however, are in normal (ascending)
chronological order.

19-Jun-2006
	- res added functions cs_malloc() etc. that always resolve to the same
	  allocation functions CS uses. Also replaced malloc with cs_malloc in
	  CS itself.
18-Jun-2006
	- res added conveniance includes to disable/enable CS' 'new' and 
	  'delete' overrides when the memtracker is enabled.
	- res added some missing custom new re-enablings.
	- res augmented the scfArray* classes with constructors that also take
	  and SCF parent argument.
	- res made an interface version iGradient of csGradient, so you can
	  pass them across plugins.
	- res fixed spr2d's SetColor() to actually do something again.
	- res changed csRectRegion to use a csArray<> for rectangle storage.
17-Jun-2006
	- res added some doxygen comments for the ptmalloc override stuff.
	- res fixed compilation with MemTracker enabled.
13-Jun-2006
	- res implemented the ptmalloc shared memory stuff for Win32.
12-Jun-2006
        - res fixed the operator new and operator delete overrides to also
          work for projects that have exceptions enabled.
11-Jun-2006
        - res changed ptmalloc to better work in CS' scenario where it resides
          in a static lib and is linked into many modules.
	- res changed configure to apply -fvisibility=hidden not only to C++
	  but also to C sources.
	- res somewhat tweaked the ptmalloc unix shared mem stuff.
	- res made various compile and warning fixes.
9-Jun-2006
	- res changed the way how malloc etc. are overridden to make things
	  more friendly in case identifiers like "free" are used in code.
	- res changed the sprcal3d plugin to not use ptmalloc (since it has to
	  pass new-allocated objects into cal3d itself, which doesn't use CS'
	  allocator).
	- res simplified the scfArray implementation somewhat.
8-Jun-2006
	- res changed the spr2d to use an iArray instead of a csArray.
7-Jun-2006
	- res updated ptmalloc to the version of May 30. Also updated
	  dlmalloc to 2.8.4.
	- res augmented the ptmalloc wrapper to do some error detection in
	  debug mode.
	- res added SCF interfaces for arrays.
	- res changed csShaderVarStack& to iShaderVarStack* in interfaces.
	- res made a couple of gcc compile fixes.
	- res made the Jamfiles pick up ptmalloc.
	- res made some Linux compile fixes.
	- res made the ptmalloc wrapper asserts a bit more useful.
	- res fixed compilation in -pedantic.
	- res changed the assert-in-assert handling to print the assert using
	  the runtime functions as opposed to CS functions again. Also
	  debug-break on first nested assert.
	- res fixed an apparent name collision of some ptmalloc variables.
	- res fixed the freetype2 plugin to compile again.
	- res updated spr2d to use new SCF.
5-Jun-2006
	- res added CS::SpinLock.
	- res added csScopedLock<> (which also works on non-mutexes).
	- res changed CS::Memory::Heap to use CS::SpinLock instead of just
	  relying on dlmalloc's internal spinlock.
	- res integrated a Win32-enabled version of ptmalloc.
