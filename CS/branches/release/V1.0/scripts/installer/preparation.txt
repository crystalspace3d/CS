General:
--------
 * Install the winlibs' "Copy DLLs to CS directory" and "VC support" into
   the source tree.
 * Extract the 1.0 API docs into the source tree.
 * The installed maps should be lit with cslight: parallaxtest, partsys, 
   r3dtest, stenciltest, terrain, terrainf, castle, flarge.
  
MSVC:
-----
 * Use wkstypical. In release mode, build all. In debug mode, build grplibs,
   plgcscegui, plgsprcal3d.

MinGW:
------
 * Configure in a directory 'CS-<version_major>.<version_minor>-mingw' which 
   is on the same level as the CS source directory.
 * You need to adjust the 'CSWin32LibsDir' definition in sdk-mingw.iss to your
   local installation.
