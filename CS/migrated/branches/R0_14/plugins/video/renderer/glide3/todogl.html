This list is here for me to remember what has to be done in order to have a great glide port of Crystal Space. 
If you want to correct something, or to add something to this list, just send me a little <A HREF="#mail">mail<A>. I will try to maintain it so that it support the following hardware:
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>VoodooGraphics (Voodoo1)</STRONG>
<LI> <STRONG>Voodoo2</STRONG>
<LI> Rush
<LI> Banshee
</UL>
And the following systems:
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>Windows 9x</STRONG>
<LI> Windows NT
<LI> DOS/WATCOM
<LI> Linux
</UL>
If you have any combination of hardware and system that is not <STRONG>like this</STRONG>, be aware that this port has not been tested on this particular combination. Please, give it a try and send <A HREF="#mail">me</A> the result.
<P>

Owners of Banshee, I have a particular test to make on your system. <A HREF="#mail">ASK ME</A>.

Things that needs to be done on the Glide port:
</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>DrawPolygonQuick has to be fixed.
<LI>Lightmap size should be fixed.
<LI>MultiPass Alpha routine has to be fixed.
<LI>Check for SinglePass without Lightmap.
<LI>Calculation of the sow/tow values may have to be rewritten (faster).
<LI>Unload function called twice on the same texture... ?
<LI>2 MByte boundary has to be checked in FixedTextureMemoryManager. I have one possible solution, but I don't like it...
<LI>HighColorCacheAndManage need to be completly rewritten. The actual code is ugly.
</UL>
