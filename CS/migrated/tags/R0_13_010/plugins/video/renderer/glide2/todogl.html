<p><var>This list is here for me to remember what has to be done in order to have a great
glide port of Crystal Space. If you want to correct something, or to add something to this
list, just send me a little <a HREF="#mail">mail</a><a>. I will try to maintain it so that
it support the following hardware: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>VoodooGraphics (Voodoo1)</strong> </li>
  <li><strong>Voodoo2</strong> </li>
  <li>Rush </li>
  <li>Banshee </li>
</ul>

<p>And the following systems: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows 9x</strong> </li>
  <li>Windows NT </li>
  <li>DOS/WATCOM </li>
  <li>Linux </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any combination of hardware and system that is not <strong>like this</strong>,
be aware that this port has not been tested on this particular combination. Please, give
it a try and send </a><a HREF="#mail">me</a> the result. </p>

<p><strong><font COLOR="RED">Owners of Banshee, I have a particular test to make on your
system. <a HREF="#mail">ASK ME</a>. </font></strong></var></p>

<p><strong>Things that needs to be done on the Glide port: </strong>

<ul>
  <li>DrawPolygonQuick has to be fixed. </li>
  <li>Lightmap size should be fixed. </li>
  <li>MultiPass Alpha routine has to be fixed. </li>
  <li>Check for SinglePass without Lightmap. </li>
  <li>Calculation of the sow/tow values may have to be rewritten (faster). </li>
  <li>Unload function called twice on the same texture... ? </li>
  <li>2 MByte boundary has to be checked in FixedTextureMemoryManager. I have one possible
    solution, but I don't like it... </li>
  <li>HighColorCacheAndManage need to be completly rewritten. The actual code is ugly. </li>
</ul>
