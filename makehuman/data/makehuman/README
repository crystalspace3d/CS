In order to have the Makehuman plugin working properly, you first need to
install the Makehuman data files within the Crystal Space directory.

To do so:

- Go to the Makehuman website at
http://makehuman.org/content/download_alpha_7.html and download the version
1.0 alpha 7. You can download a simple tarball version if you don't plan to
use the Makehuman application in itself. Also, the Crystal Space plugin won't
work currently with the trunk version of Makehuman, a.k.a. 'pure python
branch', so be sure to pick the version 1.0 alpha 7.

- Extract the Makehuman package and move or copy the directory 'data' into
the path where resides this README (that is, in 'CS/data/makehuman'). You
should hence now have a directory 'CS/data/makehuman/data'.
