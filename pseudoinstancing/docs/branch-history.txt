Crystal Space detailed change log for "pseudoinstancing" branch.

21-Sep-2007
	- iceeey merged trunk into branch:
            - Updated code for all API changes.
	    - Added implementation of SetFade for instancing, not yet working.	
30-Sep-2006
	- res overhauled the instancing: 
	    - Instancing targets and variables are now passed along as simple 
	      arrays to the renderer.
	    - Fixed function fallback is provided by a special "object2world"
	      instancing target.
	    - Instancing parameters are pulled out of an array-typed shader
	      variable by the xmlshader plugin. Hence meshes can now be
	      instanced by simply attaching shader variable(s) with instancing
	      parameters.
	    - Consequently, removed instancing support from instmesh since 
	      it's general now. Made mesh generation use the new instancing
	      as well.
