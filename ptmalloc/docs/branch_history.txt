Crystal Space detailed change log.

The overall history is in reverse (descending) chronological order, so that
each new day's entries apears before the previous day's entries.  The
individual changes for each given day, however, are in normal (ascending)
chronological order.

11-Jun-2006
        - res changed ptmalloc to better work in CS' scenario where it resides
          in a static lib and is linked into many modules.
	- res changed configure to apply -fvisibility=hidden not only to C++
	  but also to C sources.
9-Jun-2006
	- res changed the way how malloc etc. are overridden to make things
	  more friendly in case identifiers like "free" are used in code.
	- res changed the sprcal3d plugin to not use ptmalloc (since it has to
	  pass new-allocated objects into cal3d itself, which doesn't use CS'
	  allocator).
	- res simplified the scfArray implementation somewhat.
8-Jun-2006
	- res changed the spr2d to use an iArray instead of a csArray.
7-Jun-2006
	- res updated ptmalloc to the version of May 30. Also updated
	  dlmalloc to 2.8.4.
	- res augmented the ptmalloc wrapper to do some error detection in
	  debug mode.
	- res added SCF interfaces for arrays.
	- res changed csShaderVarStack& to iShaderVarStack* in interfaces.
	- res made a couple of gcc compile fixes.
	- res made the Jamfiles pick up ptmalloc.
	- res made some Linux compile fixes.
	- res made the ptmalloc wrapper asserts a bit more useful.
	- res fixed compilation in -pedantic.
	- res changed the assert-in-assert handling to print the assert using
	  the runtime functions as opposed to CS functions again. Also
	  debug-break on first nested assert.
	- res fixed an apparent name collision of some ptmalloc variables.
	- res fixed the freetype2 plugin to compile again.
	- res updated spr2d to use new SCF.
5-Jun-2006
	- res added CS::SpinLock.
	- res added csScopedLock<> (which also works on non-mutexes).
	- res changed CS::Memory::Heap to use CS::SpinLock instead of just
	  relying on dlmalloc's internal spinlock.
	- res integrated a Win32-enabled version of ptmalloc.
